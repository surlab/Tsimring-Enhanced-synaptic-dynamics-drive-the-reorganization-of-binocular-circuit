# Tsimring-Enhanced-synaptic-dynamics-drive-the-reorganization-of-binocular-circuit
Repository for the code that was used to process and analyze data collected for "Enhanced synaptic dynamics drive the reorganization of binocular circuits in mouse visual cortex". This also includes code for the computational model. 

## Contributions
1. "2P Analysis" Folder: Kyle Jenks and Katya Tsimring developed the pre-processing and analysis of the 2P imaging spine and soma data. 
2. "FOV Alignment" Folder: Katya Tsimring developed the semi-automitied code to classify spines as retained, lost, or added between two timepoints
3. "Computational Modelling" Folder. Claudia Cusseddu developed the code generating the computational model (Figure 7). 
4.  "Dendritic Distance" Folder: Greggory Heller developed the code for determining the distance between spines along the dendrite, which also can be found here: https://github.com/surlab/dendritic-distance
5. "Optical Imaging Analysis" Folder: Keji Li developed the code for running the Fourier Transform analysis for the optical imaging set up 
6. "Figures" Folder: Katya Tsimring, Kyle Jenks, and Claudia Cusseddu developed the code to generate the figures for the paper
