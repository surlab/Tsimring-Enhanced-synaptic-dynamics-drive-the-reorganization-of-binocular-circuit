# Tsimring-Enhanced-synaptic-dynamics-drive-the-reorganization-of-binocular-circuit
Repository for the code that was used to process and analyze data collected for "Enhanced synaptic dynamics drive the reorganization of binocular circuits in mouse visual cortex". This also includes code for the computational model. 

Kyle Jenks and Katya Tsimring contributed to the pre-processing and analysis of the 2P imaging spine and soma data. Greggory Heller contributed to the FOV alignment (the "dendritic_distance" folder), and Claudia Cusseddu contribute to the computational model.
