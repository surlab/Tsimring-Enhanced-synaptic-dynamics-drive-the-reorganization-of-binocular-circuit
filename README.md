# Tsimring-Enhanced-synaptic-dynamics-drive-the-reorganization-of-binocular-circuit
Repository for the code that was used to process and analyze data collected for "Enhanced synaptic dynamics drive the reorganization of binocular circuits in mouse visual cortex". This also includes code for the computational model. 

Kyle Jenks and Katya Tsimring contributed to the pre-processing and analysis of the 2P imaging spine and soma data. Claudia Cusseddu contributed to the computational model. Greggory Heller contributed to the code for determining the distance between spines along the dendrite, which can be found here: https://github.com/surlab/dendritic-distance
