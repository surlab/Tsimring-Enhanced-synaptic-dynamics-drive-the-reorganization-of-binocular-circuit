The code was written in Matlab 2023b. It should work with other versions as well.

The figure 7 can be reproduced by simply running the script main.m on Matlab - results may slightly differ due to randomness.
Change the parameters ntrials (default = 20) to have different number of trials.
Each trial should take about 25-30 minutes to run.
Change sigma_het (default = 1.5) and sigma_heb (default = 15) to vary the heterosynaptic and the Hebbian factor, respectively. 
All the other parameters are as defined in the main paper. The code automatically saves the output for each trial in a .mat file, that can be then used to plot the results. 
To see an example without running new simulations please download the five .zip files "demoXX-YY.zip" containing results for 20 simulations (in total). The simulations were splitted to keep a size limit of 25mb. Please save all the .mat files from the .zip files in a single folder and run the other scripts as follows.

The script fig7B.m can be used to get an example as in Figure 7B.
The script fig7C_D_E.m can be used to reproduce panel C, D, and E in figure 7. 
Figure 7F can be reproduced together with Figure S8 through the script figS8.m in the following way: first, choose the parameters that determine the heterosynaptic and the Hebbian factors (sigma_het, sigma_heb, in the script main.m ). Run the main.m for each choice of (sigma_het, sigma_heb). Load the results in figS8.m and find average spine pair correlation and average mismatch in the somatic response for the given values of (sigma_het, sigma_heb) and multiple trials. 

The files preferred_orientation.m and test.m are functions to determine the somaâ€™s preferred orientation and the somatic response for eight possible directions when plasticity is turned off, and they are used in the script figS8.m
